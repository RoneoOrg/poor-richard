HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania has officially declared President-elect Joe Biden as the state’s presidential winner, <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pennsylvania-election-certification-counties-donald-trump-delays/">certifying election results</a> for all 67 counties and bringing officials one step closer to formally closing out an election like no other.

Gov. Tom Wolf said Tuesday he had signed the Certificate of Ascertainment, a federally required document given to the national archivist that contains the names of the 20 electors for Biden and the 20 electors for President Donald Trump.

Counties were <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pennsylvania-election-certification-counties-donald-trump-delays/">required to submit</a> their certified results to Secretary of the Commonwealth Kathy Boockvar by Monday.

Only Biden’s <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pennsylvania-election-2020-electors-who-are-they-faithless-legislature/">electors will go to Harrisburg on Dec. 14</a> to formally cast their votes for the former vice president, who won Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes, according to the Department of State.

“Today’s certification is a testament to the incredible efforts of our local and state election officials, who worked tirelessly to ensure Pennsylvania had a free, fair and accurate process that reflects the will of the voters,” Wolf said in a statement.

While all 67 county boards of elections certified results, several — including Allegheny, Montgomery, and Luzerne Counties — were split along partisan lines, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-certification-election-results-third-circuit-trump-counties-20201123.html">with Republicans voting against certification</a>, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

“We are tremendously grateful to all 67 counties who have been working extremely long hours to ensure that every qualified voter’s vote is counted safely and securely,” Boockvar said in a statement. “The county election officials and the poll workers are the true heroes of our democracy, enabling us to vote in record numbers, amid challenging circumstances, so that every eligible voter’s voice could be heard.”

Days after the election, state Republicans — including House Speaker Bryan Cutler (R., Lancaster) and Rep. Dawn Keefer (R., York) — <a href="http://www.pahousegop.com/Display/SiteFiles/1/OtherDocuments/2020/Governor%20Wolf%20-%20Election%20Audit%20-%20NOV%202020.pdf">asked Wolf for a full audit of the election prior to certification of the results</a>.

In 2016, the Department of State <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/electoral-college/2016/ascertainment-pennsylvania.pdf">took more than a month to certify the results</a>.
