HARRISBURG — Democratic state Sen. Anthony H. Williams has tested positive for the coronavirus, becoming the second Pennsylvania legislator to contract the virus.

In a statement, Williams, of Philadelphia, said he is following recommended health guidelines, and had informed Senate Democratic leadership, his colleagues, and those he had come into contact with “so they can take the necessary steps to evaluate if they are running any risk.”

Williams also said that he is closing his offices for two weeks “out of an abundance of caution.”

Brittany Crampsie, a spokesperson for Senate Democrats, said Williams received the result Tuesday. Fewer than 10 staffers who were exposed to the senator in recent weeks have been told to work from home, she said.

“We recommended they contact their personal physicians and seek a test, and we provided information for local testing centers,” Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny) said in a statement. “If any of their tests are positive, we will expand our contact tracing.”

It was not immediately known when Williams took the test, what prompted him to seek one, or when he was last in Harrisburg. He did not respond to a request for an interview.

Williams’ social media posts show that he has attended a handful of in-person events over the last few weeks. That includes a June 30 press conference at the Capitol with other Democratic senators, including Costa. All senators, including Williams, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/anthony.h.williams/videos/2405995759700904" target=_blank>wore masks</a>.

Kate Flessner, a spokesperson for Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati (R., Jefferson), declined to comment on how the Republican caucus is dealing with Williams’ disclosure, saying only that the chamber has policies and protocols in place when there is potential exposure to COVID-19 in the workplace. She did not provide any information about those protocols.

In late May — after a Republican House member revealed, a week after his diagnosis, that <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/05/pennsylvania-republican-lawmaker-coronavirus-democrats-questions/" target=_blank>he had tested positive for COVID-19</a> — Williams wrote Scarnati asking that the chamber mandate disclosure of a potential coronavirus exposure to all four caucuses in both the House and Senate.

In his letter, Williams noted that while the Senate had adopted a policy requiring disclosure of a coronavirus case, only people who work for the upper chamber would be informed.

“As the budget and other important bills have been negotiated over the past several weeks, staff and members from all four caucuses have interacted with each other in person, increasing the risk for chain transmission,” Williams wrote in the May 28 letter to Scarnati.

The belated revelation that Rep. Andrew Lewis (R., Dauphin) had tested positive for COVID-19 sparked outrage among his Democratic colleagues who complained that they had been left in the dark about the diagnosis.

At the time, Lewis said he immediately began self-isolating after receiving the test result and that he informed House officials, who worked to identify anyone he may have exposed.

But while some Republican lawmakers were notified of their potential exposure and self-isolated as a result, Democrats say they only learned of it from a reporter, despite their own daily proximity to Lewis.
