<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> is an independent, nonpartisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with PennLive/The Patriot-News, TribLIVE/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and WITF Public Media. </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><i>Sign up for our free newsletters</i></a><i>.</i>

Thousands of Pennsylvanians may soon risk losing their homes as a federal eviction ban lifts on July 31 and counties across the state remain backlogged with <a href="https://www.dhs.pa.gov/ERAP/Pages/ERAP.aspx" target="_blank">applications for rental assistance</a>. These are difficult systems to manage, not least because each county has its own provisions and resources.

On Thursday, Aug. 5 at 5 p.m., join <b>Charlotte Keith </b>of Spotlight PA, <b>Kyle Webster </b>of <a href="https://actionhousing.org/" target="_blank">Action Housing</a>, and <b>Michelle Dempsky</b> of <a href="https://www.lasp.org/" target="_blank">Legal Aid of Southeastern PA</a> for a free panel and Q&amp;A on everything we know about evictions and rental assistance in Pennsylvania.

RSVP for FREE <a href="https://inquirer.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_UIAwAxFySyKL9KdorLW1tQ">here</a>. Submit your questions in advance to <a href="mailto:events@spotlightpa.org">events@spotlightpa.org</a>
