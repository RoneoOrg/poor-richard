Want to know where to get the COVID-19 vaccine in Pennsylvania? We’ve got you covered.

Below is a map of current vaccine providers as provided by the state Department of Health. Spotlight PA is unable to independently verify the information for every provider included by the health department on this map. Availability of the vaccine varies by provider, and you should contact them directly to learn more about how to get it. This map will update every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, consistent with updates from state health officials. We’ll be adding additional vaccine data to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pa-coronavirus-updates-cases-map-live-tracker/" target=_blank>our coronavirus tracker</a> as well as our <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/" target=_blank>weekly COVID-19 alerts email customized to your county</a>.

<i><b>Update 4/12/2021:</b></i><i> State health officials announced all Pennsylvanians 16 and older will be eligible to schedule a coronavirus vaccine appointment beginning April 13. </i>
