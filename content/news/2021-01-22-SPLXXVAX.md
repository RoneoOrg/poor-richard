Want to know where to get the COVID-19 vaccine in Pennsylvania? We’ve got you covered.

Below is a map of current vaccine providers as provided by the state Department of Health. Spotlight PA is unable to independently verify the information for every provider included by the health department on this map. Availability of the vaccine varies by provider, and you should contact them directly to learn more about how to get it.

This map will update consistent with updates from state health officials. We’ll be adding additional vaccine data to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pa-coronavirus-updates-cases-map-live-tracker/" target=_blank>our coronavirus tracker</a> as well as our <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters/" target=_blank>weekly COVID-19 alerts email customized to your county</a>. Philadelphia is a separate vaccine jurisdiction, and local information can be found <a href="https://www.phila.gov/programs/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/vaccines/data/">here</a> and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/a/covid-19-vaccine-registration-philadelphia-new-jersey-20210120.html">here.</a>

Pennsylvania is currently in <b>Phase 1A</b> of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan. Learn more about who is eligible in each stage below the map.

<i><b>Update 2/3:</b></i><i> After widespread frustration, state officials have stopped attempting to provide information about vaccine availability, which was unreliable. We've added a county-by-county provider listing tab to the map for easier searching. In response to your questions, we've also posted a story on <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/01/pa-covid-vaccine-availability-frustration-statewide-signup-explainer/">why Pennsylvania doesn't have a centralized sign-up for the vaccine.</a> Many providers are creating waiting lists or other ways to indicate your interest. You should visit provider websites or contact them directly for their latest information and availability. </i>
