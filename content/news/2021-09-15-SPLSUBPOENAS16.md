HARRISBURG — The state Senate committee undertaking a controversial review of last year’s presidential election results on Wednesday authorized subpoenas for personal information on every registered voter in Pennsylvania.

The 7-to-4 vote along partisan lines by the Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee allows the panel to demand that the Department of State, which oversees elections statewide, turn over the name, address, driver’s license and partial social security number of every voter registered as of last November.

The subpoenas also request all email and other written communications between the Department of State and elections officials in every Pennsylvania county.

That information, Senate officials said, would then be turned over to a yet-to-be-identified private company, which would carry out the review. The committee’s chair, Republican Sen. Cris Dush of Jefferson County, refused to provide any information about which companies he is vetting for the job.

Dush did say Wednesday, under questioning by Democratic senators critical of the investigation, that the company would be paid with taxpayer dollars. Top Senate officials earlier this week said they do not have a specific budget for their review, nor have they set a ceiling on how much they are willing to spend on it.

Democrats, including those in Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration, have blasted the GOP’s election inquiry as a partisan and baseless attack on the legitimate outcome of the 2020 election. On Wednesday, the committee’s Democratic senators peppered Dush with questions, many of them centering around the panel’s authority to issue subpoenas and the GOP’s efforts to find and vet a private company — which Dush largely sidestepped or refused to answer.

“You are incapable right now today to tell the members of this committee and the public who will have access to that information … and whether that information will be made public,” said Sen. Steve Santarsiero (D., Bucks).

Sen. Anthony Williams (D., Philadelphia) was critical of the lack of information. He said turning over private voter information to an outside company “should be scary to all of us.”

“This should be seen as a betrayal of those who are here to represent you,” said Williams.

The Republican subpoena not only seeks the personal information of voters registered as of November of last year, but also requests lists of voters who participated in the 2020 elections and the May 2021 primary. Republicans said Wednesday morning they would use the information to verify the identity of voters, but it was unclear to what specific end.

Republican leader and Senate President Pro Tempore Jake Corman (R., Centre) said his office has been inundated with voter concerns about the integrity of last year’s election — even as he has publicly acknowledged that he has no evidence of wrongdoing or fraud.
