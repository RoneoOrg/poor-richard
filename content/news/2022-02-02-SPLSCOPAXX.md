HARRISBURG — The Pennsylvania Supreme Court took control of the high-stakes decision of selecting the state’s next congressional map, pre-empting a lower court ruling at the last minute in a move that will surely draw partisan scrutiny from Republicans.

The state Commonwealth Court had been <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/01/pennsylvania-redistricting-congressional-map-court-hearing-recap/" target="_blank">set to rule on a map after soliciting proposals</a> from an array of interested parties in the case. Instead, the high court will now receive a report from the lower court, additional briefs, and hold a hearing Feb. 18, three days after the date to begin circulating nominating petitions.

Two groups of Pennsylvania residents originally filed suit in Commonwealth Court to ensure that the May primary occurs on schedule. The court set a Jan. 30 deadline for Gov. Tom Wolf and the General Assembly to agree upon a map, and it solicited map submissions and held hearings.

This is the second time the high court — where Democrats hold the majority — had been asked to take the case. It originally declined, opting instead to give the lower court the chance to review the case and issue a ruling.
