HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania state lawmakers would get final say over their own political districts under a new proposal moving through the legislature.

The proposed amendment to the state constitution would eliminate the five-member panel of top legislative leaders and a nonpartisan chair that currently draws the state House and Senate maps every 10 years.

It was introduced by Rep. Seth Grove (R., York), who has accused the Legislative Reapportionment Commission of creating a state House map that unfairly benefits Democrats.

While the preliminary map has the potential to significantly shift the balance of power in the chamber, redistricting advocates say that’s because it unwinds decades of gerrymandering in favor of the GOP. Nonpartisan analysis of the map shows it still favors Republicans.

The change would empower the legislative branch and ensure greater public input, Grove said Monday during a meeting of the House State Government Committee. Democrats and nonpartisan good-government groups, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-redistricting-republicans-constitutional-amendment-20220110.html">decried the proposal as an attempted power grab that does nothing to remove lawmaker influence from the process</a>.

The resolution, which passed along party lines, would create an 11-person commission composed of eight citizens selected by caucus leaders as well as two county officials and a former judge from Commonwealth Court. The final decision over the maps would be left to the General Assembly.

Unlike a bill, which can be vetoed by the governor, proposed changes to the state constitution go directly to the voters. First, the proposal must pass the House and Senate in two consecutive sessions.
