HARRISBURG — A key state House committee has released its preliminary congressional map, a major step forward in the redistricting process.

The map was drawn by Lehigh County resident Amanda Holt, who <a href="https://www.pubintlaw.org/cases-and-projects/pennsylvania-legislative-reapportionment-commissions/">became a plaintiff in a case</a> against the state House and Senate maps a decade ago and won.

Rep. Seth Grove (R., York), chair of the House State Government Committee, said the panel will hold an informational hearing Thursday and a voting meeting on Monday.

“Over the last several months, advocates and everyday Pennsylvanians told us they didn’t want the process of years’ past,” Grove said in a statement. “The people of Pennsylvania asked for increased public involvement, a map that was drawn by people, not by politicians, and the opportunity to offer comment on a preliminary plan before a final vote was taken.”
