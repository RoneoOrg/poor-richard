HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania’s highest court will hear arguments today from lawyers for Gov. Tom Wolf, top lawmakers, and voters as it decides what the state’s congressional districts will look like for the next decade.

The state Supreme Court agreed to take over the highly consequential process in early February after a lower appellate judge held hearings on more than a dozen map proposals.

Commonwealth Court Judge Patricia McCullough <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/02/pennsylvania-redistricting-congressional-map-recommendation/">recommended the justices pick the map</a> passed by the Republican-controlled General Assembly and rejected by Wolf, who called it “highly skewed.” The high court is not required to follow McCullough’s counsel and can pick one of the proposals, alter them, or draw a different map.

The court is working against the clock. Already, it has paused the primary election calendar and delayed the signature collecting process for candidates.

Pennsylvania is unable to use its current congressional map as the state lost one of its 18 seats due to sluggish population growth.

This is not the first time the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has been asked to weigh in on the state’s congressional districts. In 2018, it threw out the map approved by former Republican Gov. Tom Corbett in 2011, finding it to be an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.

Spotlight PA will have updates on the hearing throughout the day.
