HARRISBURG — A state panel Friday approved Pennsylvania’s new legislative district maps, which could substantially alter the balance of power in the General Assembly for the next decade but are likely to be challenged in court by Republicans unhappy with the state House plan.

The Legislative Reapportionment Commission — a five-person panel composed of the top General Assembly leaders and an independent chair — voted 4-1 to approve the maps, with Chair Mark Nordenberg joining the two Democrats and Senate Majority Leader Kim Ward (R., Westmoreland).

Compared to the <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/12/pennsylvania-redistricting-state-house-map-score-analysis/">initial plan released in December</a>, the new state House map reduces the number of incumbent Republicans who would have to face off against one another. The final state Senate map remains largely unchanged, though it was amended to create a new district in Philadelphia with a significant number of Hispanic voters.

While the approval marks the end of this part of the redistricting process, the maps are likely to face further scrutiny. Anyone can bring a challenge over either map directly to the state Supreme Court over the next 30 days, which, based on Republican opposition, is expected to happen.

The final state Senate map passed Friday with little debate, as did the initial version in December. It improves upon fairness metrics laid out in the state constitution and is expected to maintain the balance of power in the GOP-controlled chamber.

Advocates for an independent and transparent redistricting process argued the initial map overly accommodated incumbents, and the final version maintains two incumbent matchups.

The state House map, by contrast, has drawn fiery criticism from Republicans, who called it a Democratic gerrymander as it creates more seats that could be won by members of that party.

Redistricting advocates said the shift seems so severe because the map reverses decades of gerrymandering in favor of Republicans. Nonpartisan analyses show that the state House map approved Friday improves upon neutral fairness criteria and still has a Republican bias.

The partisan shift also reflects the <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/08/pa-redistricting-2020-census-data-takeaways/">population changes Pennsylvania experienced</a> over the past decade, with rural areas losing residents and urban and suburban areas in the southeast gaining them.

House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff (R., Centre) offered an unsuccessful amendment to his chamber’s map Friday, which he said <a href="http://www.pahousegopnews.com/AttachedFiles/02.04.22/Executive%20Summary%20Benninghoff%20Amendment.pdf">maintained or improved fairness metrics</a> while splitting fewer areas and creating more minority voting districts.

In a press conference before the vote, Benninghoff again accused Nordenberg and nonpartisan good-government groups of acting for political reasons. Nordenberg has <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/pennsylvania/pennsnylvania-redistricting-2022-mark-nordenberg-interview-20211226.html">defended himself against such claims</a>, saying the process provided “equal opportunity for the representatives of each caucus.”

Citing an analysis by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project for The Inquirer, Benninghoff said the state’s political geography — with Democrats clustered in urban areas and Republicans spread out — <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/inq2/pennsylvania-redistricting-2022-state-house-map-analysis-20211216.html">gives the minority party about 93 seats in the state House</a>.

“Our goal is to follow the constitution,” Benninghoff said. “This is, in my opinion, trying to make water flow uphill.”

Redistricting academics have explained that while the state’s political geography is beneficial to Republicans, mapmakers can create plans that reflect the overall partisan makeup of the state — where Democrats outnumber Republicans — while still abiding by the fairness criteria mandated in the state’s constitution.

With court challenges likely, candidates for office are facing an uncertain future <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2022/01/pennsylvania-primary-2022-redistricting-delays/">as the Feb. 15 start date to collect signatures</a> for the May primary rapidly approaches.

A group of residents in areas of the state that saw large population growth over the past decade filed a suit in Commonwealth Court requesting it to adopt a new election calendar. The court in late January rejected a request from the petitioners to hold a “prompt” status conference.

The attorney representing the petitioners said to “expect further action in the coming days.”
