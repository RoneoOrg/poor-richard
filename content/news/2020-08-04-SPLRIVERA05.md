HARRISBURG — As districts across the state plot how to safely reopen schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, Pennsylvania’s top education official will leave his post this fall to lead a technical college.

Education Secretary Pedro Rivera will serve as the next president of Thaddeus Stevens College in Lancaster, the school said in a press release Tuesday. Rivera will assume the position on Oct. 1.

Gov. Tom Wolf said in a statement he plans to nominate Deputy Secretary of Postsecondary and Higher Education Noe Ortega to replace Rivera.

“His leadership has been critical during the commonwealth’s response to COVID-19,” Wolf said of Rivera, “and the relationships he cultivated with education stakeholders during his tenure have strengthened the ties between state and local partners and allowed local schools to inform state education policy.”
