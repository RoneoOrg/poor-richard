HARRISBURG — As districts across the state plot how to safely reopen schools amid the coronavirus pandemic, Pennsylvania’s top education official will leave his post this fall to lead a technical college.

The board of Thaddeus Stevens College in Lancaster voted Tuesday to make Education Secretary Pedro Rivera its next president, the school said in a press release. 

The Wolf administration is expected to make its own announcement shortly. 

“His experience in education, leadership, and governmental policy align with the needs of the institution, and his strength and drive will serve to advance the mission of the college throughout the commonwealth, impacting the lives of economically and socially underserved students and their families for generations,” Maryann Marotta, a trustee of the college, said in a release.
