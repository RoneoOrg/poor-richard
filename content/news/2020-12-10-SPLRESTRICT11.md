HARRISBURG â€” Gov. Tom Wolf is suspending indoor dining for three weeks beginning Saturday as part of a renewed effort to slow the coronavirus surge in Pennsylvania.

On Thursday, Wolf and Health Secretary Rachel Levine also announced a three-week suspension of in-person extracurricular activities and sports at public and private schools. Collegiate and professional activities such as the NFL may continue, though spectators will be banned.

Indoor events will be limited to no more than 10 people, and outdoor events to no more than 50 people, until at least Jan. 4. Churches, synagogues, temples, mosques, and other places of worship are excluded.

Entertainment facilities including movie theaters, concert venues, casinos, and clubs must temporarily close, while indoor retail stores must limit their capacity to 50%. Gyms and fitness facilities were also directed to pause indoor operations for three weeks.

The restrictions come as new confirmed coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania continue to break records and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/12/pennsylvania-hospitals-coronavirus-staffing-shortages/">hospitals struggle</a> to stay ahead of rising admissions and a potential staffing crisis. Wolf is currently isolating at home after <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/12/governor-tom-wolf-coronavirus-positive-pennsylvania/">testing positive for COVID-19</a>.

The state Department of Health <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/03/pa-coronavirus-updates-cases-map-live-tracker/">reported 11,972 new cases</a> Thursday. As of this morning, hospitals in the southwest and south-central regions of the state were <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx">reporting that they anticipate staffing shortages within the next week</a>, state data show.

The mitigation efforts announced Thursday do not include a blanket stay-at-home order like the measures taken at the beginning of the pandemic this spring. Rather, they are focused on preventing people from congregating and spending extended periods of time indoors and close to each other.
