HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania will lift most coronavirus-related restrictions on Memorial Day, state officials announced Tuesday, while keeping in place a universal masking order until more people are vaccinated.

The mask order will be lifted when 70% of Pennsylvanians older than 17 are fully vaccinated, according to the statement. Currently, a mask or other face-covering must be worn outside of the home, except during certain activities.

About half of Pennsylvania residents — 5,456,088 people — have received their first dose of a two-dose vaccine, or a complete one-shot regimen, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show.
