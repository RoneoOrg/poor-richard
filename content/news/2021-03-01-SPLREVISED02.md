HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf announced Monday that he is lifting some statewide COVID-19 restrictions effective immediately, upping occupancy limits for both indoor and outdoor events and eliminating out-of-state travel restrictions in place since November. Mask mandates and social distancing rules remain in effect.

Pointing to declining case numbers and increasing vaccination numbers, the governor said he’s taking a “measured approach” to easing restrictions put in place by his administration over the past year. Monday’s announcement comes just under one year after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/03/18/coronavirus-first-COVID-19-death-Pennsylvania-Northampton-county-pa/stories/202003180144">Pennsylvania recorded its first coronavirus death on March 18, 2020</a>. Twenty-four thousand more Pennsylvanians have died from the virus since then.

“There is light at the end of the tunnel,” Wolf said Monday, adding, “We need to balance protecting public health with leading the state to a robust economic recovery. We are lifting mitigation efforts only when we believe it is safe to do so.”

Under the revised and lifted rules, maximum occupancy limits for indoor events are increasing to 15% of a venue’s maximum occupancy with a 6-foot physical distancing requirement still in place. Outdoor gathering limits will increase to 20% of a venue’s capacity, and out-of-state travel restrictions are eliminated, removing 14-day quarantine and testing requirements for incoming travelers.
