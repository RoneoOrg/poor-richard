HARRISBURG — A panel of Pennsylvania’s most powerful lawmakers unveiled new proposed maps for the state’s House and Senate districts Thursday, a major milestone in the once-in-a-decade redistricting process that will permanently alter politics in the state.

You can <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::5db459af-cfbf-42d0-839e-30230a97f34e">view the House map here</a>. The Senate map will be available shortly.

The maps were drafted by the Legislative Reapportionment Commission, a five-person panel that includes the four top legislative leaders from both parties in the General Assembly and a nonpartisan chairperson selected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

They will shape the political future of Pennsylvania’s 50-member Senate and 203-member House, which are both controlled by Republicans. The legislature wields significant influence, setting policy and budgetary priorities that affect everyone in the state.

Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has for years served as a firewall for the Republican agenda, but that could change depending on the outcome of next year’s gubernatorial election. Wolf, who is term-limited, cannot run again, setting up a wide-open race sure to attract national attention.
