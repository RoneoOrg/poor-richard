HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday vetoed legislation that would have allowed more Pennsylvania businesses to reopen over the objections of the state’s top health official.

The measure <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-coronavirus-legislature-senate-vote-reopen-business/">was approved</a> in the General Assembly along party lines, with Democrats saying the bill was premature and unsafe, as the state lacks sufficient testing for COVID-19 and personal protective equipment for health care workers. Republicans, meanwhile, claimed more businesses could reopen safely if they adhered to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention measures on social distancing.

GOP lawmakers do not have enough votes to override Wolf’s veto.

“This is not an easy decision, but it is the right course for Pennsylvania,” Wolf said in his veto message. “Reopening tens of thousands of businesses too early will only increase the spread of the virus, place more lives at risk, increase the death tolls, and extend the length of the economic hardships created by the pandemic.”

In March, Wolf ordered all but “life-sustaining” businesses to close their physical operations. As of Monday, 1.5 million Pennsylvanians had filed for unemployment benefits.

Hundreds of people <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-anti-shutdown-rally-harrisburg/" target=_blank>protested</a> outside the Capitol on Monday, calling for an end to the closures. At the same time, Wolf announced he would extend the stay-at-home order to May 8, but also <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-coronavirus-reopen-wine-liquor-construction-car-dealerships/" target=_blank>allow some sectors</a> to begin reopening at that time.
