One of Pennsylvania’s two U.S. Senate seats is up for grabs in 2022 as two-term Republican incumbent Pat Toomey prepares to step aside and the state braces for a <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/06/pa-2020-governor-race-candidates/">particularly high-stakes election year</a>.

The Senate opening has drawn plenty of interest from Democrats looking to shore up a narrow congressional majority, Republicans looking to limit key aspects of the Biden agenda, and observers believing the seat is <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/05/politics/2022-senate-race-rankings-july/index.html">likely to flip</a> or <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">too close to call</a>. The race will be exceedingly expensive either way.

### Democrats

With less than a year to go until the primary (<a href="https://apnews.com/article/primary-elections-pennsylvania-elections-census-2020-house-elections-9c91a3caf8d761ede5bb456c6898e539">unless the date is changed because of redistricting issues</a>), several higher-profile Democrats are officially in the running — others are rumored to be waiting in the wings.

<b>Montgomery County Commissioner Valerie Arkoosh</b> (<a href="https://www.valarkoosh.com/">website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ValArkooshPA">Twitter</a>) is in the former category and running to be the first woman senator from Pennsylvania. She brings a high-profile Emily’s List endorsement to the race and a <a href="https://www.politicspa.com/arkoosh-raises-over-1-million-in-q2/98587/">significant amount of cash on hand</a>.

<b>Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman</b> (<a href="https://johnfetterman.com/">website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnFetterman">Twitter</a>) has also declared his second run for Toomey’s seat in six years, this time with burgeoning household-name status, <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/fetterman-dwarfs-competition-in-first-fundraising-numbers-for-pa-s-senate-race/">way more money</a>, and <a href="https://www.theroot.com/john-fetterman-has-had-eight-years-to-apologize-for-pul-1846249115">more scrutiny</a>, too.

<b>State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta</b> (<a href="https://www.malcolmkenyatta.com/">website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/malcolmkenyatta">Twitter</a>) — the first openly gay Black man to be elected to the state legislature — brings rising-star momentum, progressive bona fides, and <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/malcolm-kenyatta-gettysburg-democratic-pennsylvania-senate-race-20210713.html">a string of viral moments</a> to compete with Fetterman’s fundraising juggernaut.

<b>State Sen. Sharif Street</b> (<a href="https://streetforpa.com/">website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/streetforpa">Twitter</a>) — the <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/how-many-more-must-die-philly-lawmakers-plead-for-help-reducing-gun-violence/">pro-gun reform</a>, pro-retail politics Philadelphia lawmaker — formally announced his intent to run but has yet to file a financial report with the FEC. Pennsylvania hasn’t had a Black U.S. senator before.

<b>U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb</b> (<a href="https://conorlamb.com/" target="_blank">website</a> | <a href="https://twitter.com/ConorLambPA?s=20" target="_blank">Twitter</a>) launched his centrist primary bid in Pittsburgh in August. Lamb’s interest comes with his current job <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/04/pa-us-house-seat-congressional-census-announcement-redistricting/">possibly set to be drawn out of existence</a>.

<b>Carla Sands</b> (<a href="https://twitter.com/CarlaHSands/status/1412416656903704584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1412416656903704584%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.politicspa.com%2Fsands-launches-2022-senate-bid%2F98572%2F">Twitter</a>) is Trump’s former ambassador to Denmark and a <a href="https://triblive.com/news/pennsylvania/ex-ambassador-investment-ceo-carla-sands-seeks-pennsylvania-senate-seat/">well-connected and well-financed</a> investment CEO who’s from Cumberland County but spent much of her adult life in California.
