The long-awaited state House and Senate redistricting maps are finally here and could dramatically alter the balance of power in the state.

House Republicans currently hold a 113-90 advantage, but according to one redistricting expert the new map creates about 102 districts that lean Democratic, opening the possibility of control of the chamber shifting for the first time in at least a decade.

The redrawing of the districts will also affect the political sway of communities of color —-—which have driven Pennsylvania’s population growth over the past decade. The share of residents who identify as white alone declined from nearly 82% to 75% from 2010 to 2020, as the Hispanic population grew and the number of Black residents remained roughly the same. The public comment period for these maps — which ends in a few weeks — offers these communities a rare chance to shape their political future in the state.

Join us Thursday, Jan. 6 at noon EST for a free breakdown of the newly released state House and Senate maps, how the maps could shift political power, and their potential impact on Pennsylvanians.

Our panelists include:

- <b>Kate Huangpu</b>, redistricting reporter for Spotlight PA<br/>

- <b>Carol Kuniholm</b>, chairperson for Fair Districts PA<br/>

- Others to be announced<br/>
