<i>This article is part of a yearlong reporting project focused on redistricting and gerrymandering in Pennsylvania. It is made possible by the support of </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i>Spotlight PA</i></a><i> members and </i><a href="https://votebeat.org/"><i>Votebeat</i></a><i>, a project focused on election integrity and voting access.</i>

A Pennsylvania redistricting panel has approved final state House and Senate maps, and the new districts could fundamentally reshape the legislature.

The maps were <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/12/pennsylvania-redistricting-state-house-senate-maps/">drafted and given initial approval</a> in December by the Legislative Reapportionment Commission, a five-person panel made up of the four top legislative leaders from both major parties and a nonpartisan chair selected by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.

The panel voted 4-1 in February to approve final versions of the maps, though they are likely to face further scrutiny. Anyone can bring a challenge to either map directly to the state Supreme Court over the next 30 days, which, based on Republican opposition to the state House map, is expected to happen.

<i>About the data: The Legislative Reapportionment Commission provided </i><a href="https://www.redistricting.state.pa.us/maps/"><i>preliminary map files</i></a><i>. Unlike a decade ago, the panel drew new districts using data that reallocated incarcerated people with a sentence under 10 years to the district of their last known home address.</i>

<i>The </i><a href="https://redistrictingdatahub.org/"><i>Redistricting Data Hub</i></a><i> provided voter registration data as of August 2021, and Peter Horton cleaned and reformatted census data used to conduct this analysis. This analysis also used data from </i><a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#home"><i>Dave’s Redistricting</i></a><i>.</i>

<i>Thanks to the Texas Tribune for sharing information about its </i><a href="https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2021/texas-redistricting-map/"><i>version of the tool</i></a><i> and to </i><a href="http://kentmwilhelm.com/"><i>Kent Wilhelm</i></a><i> for design help.</i>
