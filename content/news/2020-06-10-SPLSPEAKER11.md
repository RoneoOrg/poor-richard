HARRISBURG — House Speaker Mike Turzai, one of the most powerful Republicans in the Pennsylvania legislature, announced Wednesday he will resign his seat just months before he was set to retire. 

During an emotional speech to the chamber, Turzai told lawmakers his last day in the Capitol will be June 15. 

“I’ve been blessed to have served almost 20 years representing the citizens of the 28th Legislative District in the north suburbs of Allegheny County, north of Pittsburgh," he said. "What an honor.”
