HARRISBURG — Setting the stage for a post-election showdown in the Pennsylvania Capitol, Republicans who control the state Senate will refuse to seat a Democratic senator whose narrow win in November is being challenged in the courts, even as it has been certified by election officials.

Democratic leaders said they were told Monday that Sen. Jim Brewster of Allegheny County will not be permitted to take the oath of office Tuesday when the legislature returns to launch a new two-year session.

Republicans, according to Senate Minority Leader Jay Costa (D., Allegheny), have said they want to await the outcome of a federal legal challenge by Brewster’s GOP challenger, Nicole Ziccarelli.

At the heart of the dispute is Ziccarelli’s request to throw out several hundred mail ballots counted by Allegheny County election officials that lacked a handwritten date on the outer ballot envelope, as required by state law. Those ballots gave Brewster the edge he needed to eke out a win.

“We believe this is an illegal, unlawful attempt not to seat Sen. Brewster,” said Costa, who described the maneuver as out of the “Trump playbook” of contesting legitimate and certified election results.

Sen. Vincent Hughes (D., Philadelphia) put it this way: “It’s a robbery.”

In a statement Monday, the top Republican in the Senate, Jake Corman, signaled that he wants a court decision in the case before swearing in a senator to represent the district.

“We understand that this issue needs to be resolved promptly, while ensuring that the constituents of the 45th Senate District have properly elected representation,” Corman said of Brewster’s district. “Constituents in that community will continue to receive assistance with their state-related issues.”
