HARRISBURG — Following months of <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/psers-compensation-gifts-sec-fbi-pension-fund-pennsylvania-teachers-subpoena-20210925.html">controversy </a>and amid an <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/business/psers-pension-fbi-pa-probe-subpoenas-20210516.html">ongoing federal investigation</a>, Pennsylvania’s biggest pension fund on Thursday announced that its top two executives were leaving their jobs.

With no explanation and after a meeting closed to the public and media, the PSERS board said that executive director <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/psers-grell-pension-teachers-recalculation-20210418.html">Glen Grell, 64, </a>and investment chief James H. Grossman Jr., 54, were both retiring.

The agency said Grell would step down at the end of the year and be given a consulting role with the $73 billion fund. The board said little about that or about Grossman’s future during its meeting Thursday morning. Grossman, paid $485,000 yearly, has been the highest paid employee in state government, paid for more than twice the governor.
