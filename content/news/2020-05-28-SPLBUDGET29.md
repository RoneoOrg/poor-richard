HARRISBURG — The Pennsylvania legislature will send a short-term budget to Gov. Tom Wolf, an unusual measure made necessary by the strain put on the state’s finances by the coronavirus pandemic.

The state Senate on Thursday passed the $25.8 billion budget 44-6, just two days after the House <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/05/pennsylvania-short-term-budget-revenue-shortfall-coronavirus/" target=_blank>first presented the measure</a> and passed it along party lines.

The stopgap measure flat-funds most state agencies for five months and the Department of Education for one year. That would guarantee that schools — which over the last six years under Wolf have seen funding boosts every year — will not see cuts in state funding.

A spokesperson for Wolf was not immediately available to comment.
