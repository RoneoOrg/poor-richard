Booster shots are now available to all adults, regardless of which coronavirus vaccine they initially received, as long as the appropriate amount of time has passed since their most recent dose.

The federal Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday authorized boosters for people 18 and older who received their second shot of the two-dose Pfizer and Moderna vaccines at least six months ago. Restrictions on age, occupation, or whether a person has underlying medical conditions no longer apply.

Booster shots are also recommended for anyone 18 and older who received a Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine two or more months ago.

The CDC’s guidance allows for a “mix and match” approach to boosters. In other words, no matter which of the three vaccines you initially received, you may choose any of the three for your booster shot.

All three vaccines are now widely available, and it’s not likely providers will experience the same <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/03/pa-coronavirus-covid-vaccine-all-adults-eligible-april-19/">backups and shortages seen across Pennsylvania</a> when eligibility first opened up to all adults in April, Pennsylvania officials have said.

Many retail pharmacies, like Rite-Aid or CVS, along with grocery stores and independent pharmacies, now have same-day and walk-in appointments for first, second, and booster shots available. Health systems like <a href="https://www.upmc.com/coronavirus/covid-vaccine">UPMC</a>, <a href="https://www.ahn.org/coronavirus/vaccine">Allegheny Health Network</a>, <a href="https://vaccine-scheduler.pennstatehealth.org/s/">Penn State Health</a>, and <a href="https://www.geisinger.org/coronavirus/patients-and-visitors/covid-19-vaccine-faqs#thirddose">Geisinger</a> are also administering boosters, along with other local health clinics and doctors’ offices.

You do not have to return to the same location where you received your first or second shots for your booster. Search for locations offering COVID-19 vaccines near you, or anywhere in the country, on the CDC’s website at <a href="http://www.vaccines.gov/">vaccines.gov</a>.

Most nursing homes will handle boosters through existing relationships with local vaccine providers, a state health department spokesperson said. The health department will assist any nursing home that is not yet connected with a local vaccine provider or pharmacy secure booster shots.

Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/pages/health-details.aspx?newsid=1605">ordered</a> vaccine providers on Sept. 21 to not only provide online scheduling for booster appointments but also to provide a telephone number that connects callers to a live agent to assist with scheduling. Vaccine providers were also ordered to offer walk-in appointments.

Local Area Agencies on Aging, along with Medical Assistance Managed Care Organizations, were ordered to help schedule eligible adults and people who can’t leave their homes — a role those organizations took up earlier this year, as many older adults and others who had trouble navigating the competitive vaccine sign-up system <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/02/pennsylvania-coronavirus-rural-older-people-phase-1a-vaccinations-cvs-riteaid/">struggled to find appointments</a>.

State officials recommend that anyone who has questions about whether they are eligible for a booster shot consult with their doctor before making an appointment.

Anyone receiving a booster should bring their vaccine card to the appointment. The provider will check to make sure that it has been the appropriate amount of time since the initial shot or shots.
