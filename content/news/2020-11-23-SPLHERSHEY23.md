<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/"><i><b>Spotlight PA</b></i></a><i> is an independent, non-partisan newsroom powered by The Philadelphia Inquirer in partnership with PennLive/The Patriot-News, TribLIVE/Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, and WITF Public Media. </i><a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/newsletters"><i>Sign up for our free newsletters</i></a><i>.</i>

The Philadelphia Inquirer, Spotlight PA and ProPublica are working on a story about the Milton Hershey School. We need to reach former students to hear about their experiences during and after high school.

Is this you? Please help us by filling out the form below and sharing with your fellow alumni. We are especially hoping to hear from the class of 2011, about life 10 years later. Weâ€™ve already talked to some of your classmates, but want to hear from as many of you as possible to get a complete, accurate account that we can share with you and our readers.

Please share your experiences by answering a few questions below. You also can contact reporters Bob Fernandez (267-443-3517 or <a href="mailto:bfernandez@inquirer.com">bfernandez@inquirer.com</a>) and Charlotte Keith (717-836-6560 or <a href="mailto:ckeith@spotlightpa.org">ckeith@spotlightpa.org</a>) directly. We hope to hear from you soon.
