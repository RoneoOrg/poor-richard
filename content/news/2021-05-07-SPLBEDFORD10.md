BEDFORD — The district attorney in Bedford County will bring charges against a man who shot at civil rights marchers last August, striking one person in the face.

The announcement from Lesley Childers-Potts came just days after Spotlight PA and the Johnstown Tribune-Democrat learned she had been given the results of a State Police investigation into the shooting in early March.

When reporters from the news organizations visited Childers-Potts on March 22, they were told through an assistant that the case was still “under investigation.”

When asked about the case on Thursday, Childers-Potts said she wouldn’t release any additional information until she made her decision: “I will not comment further until that time.”

She did not respond to a follow-up question asking why she had not made a decision, despite having the State Police report for two months.
