HARRISBURG — An appellate court has ruled that Pennsylvania’s mail voting law is unconstitutional, but the decision is almost certain to be appealed and decided by the state’s highest court.

The <a href="https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Commonwealth/out/244MD21_1-28-22.pdf?cb=1" target="_blank">ruling by Commonwealth Court</a> comes in response to suits filed by Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko and a group of Republican state representatives — many of whom voted for Act 77, the 2019 law that expanded no-excuse mail voting in Pennsylvania.

A spokesperson for Gov. Tom Wolf said he could not immediately be reached for comment.

The state’s mail voting law, which passed the legislature with overwhelming bipartisan support, came under attack in the months before the 2020 presidential election. Republicans at the time challenged what they saw as the<b> </b>Wolf administration’s decision to <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/12/pennsylvania-election-2020-act-77-mail-voting-republican-audit/" target="_blank">push the limits of law</a> as uncertainty abounded over how to best keep voters safe as the pandemic raged.

Democrats have countered that GOP attempts to undermine the law are part of a national playbook to cast doubt — without evidence — on Donald Trump’s defeat by President Joe Biden. They believe it is part of an orchestrated campaign to use the legal system to sow unwarranted suspicion over election integrity.

In a statement Friday shortly after the ruling became public, Trump put out a statement praising the decision, saying: “Big news out of Pennsylvania, great patriotic spirit is developing at a level that nobody thought possible. Make America Great Again!”

Friday’s Commonwealth Court decision sets the stage for the state Supreme Court, which is dominated by Democrats, to take up the matter. The high court in 2020 largely rejected GOP efforts to scale back the law.
