HARRISBURG — A court has ruled that Pennsylvania’s mail voting law is unconstitutional, but the decision is almost certain to be appealed and decided by the state Supreme Court.

The <a href="https://www.pacourts.us/assets/opinions/Commonwealth/out/244MD21_1-28-22.pdf?cb=1" target="_blank">ruling by Commonwealth Court</a> comes in response to suits filed by Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko and a group of Republican state representatives — many of whom voted for Act 77, the law that expanded no-excuse mail voting in the state.

A spokesperson for Gov. Tom Wolf could not be immediately reached.
