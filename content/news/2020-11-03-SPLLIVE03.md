## Pre-canvassing underway in Allegheny County

<i>10:11 a.m.</i>

In Allegheny County, voters had returned 332,820 mail ballots as of Monday. From the <a href="https://triblive.com/local/regional/election-day-live-western-pa-voters-head-to-the-polls/" target=_blank>TribLIVE live blog</a>:

"Allegheny County spokesperson Amie Downs said in an update shortly after 9:30 a.m. that 80% of the ballots at the county’s warehouse are ‘at some stage of the pre-canvassing process.’ About 105,000 have had the first outer envelope opened, and around 10,000 have been taken from the secrecy envelope. Those ballots are being flattened and scanned.

Downs said the three polling places initially delayed in opening are all now open and operating. Any reports of voting machine issues have been addressed, she said, and most of them were attributed to user error."

## In Lancaster, voters lack trust in mail-in voting

<i>9:52 a.m.</i>

Sarah Paine, 44, and her wife, Kelly, 35, showed up at St. Anthony’s Catholic Church in Lancaster before 8 a.m. Tuesday hoping for change.

“We wanted to make sure we could see it get counted,” Sarah Paine said of her ballot.

“If I can shop at Walmart, I can vote in person,” Kelly added, though they’d left their three children at home because of the coronavirus. “We are ready for some change, hopefully, fingers crossed,” she said.

Neighbors in line, many of whom said they lived within a few blocks and have been voting at St. Anthony’s for over a decade, said the 15-minute wait in the cold was the longest the line had ever been.

Barbara Lassahn, 59, said she tested negative for the coronavirus before arriving at the polls but was still undecided. She is a life-long Republican, but as she entered through the church doors, she said, “I might change my mind, I don’t know. Give someone else a chance.”

Jonathan Russell, 31, who planned to vote for Biden, came to the polls because he said he doesn’t trust the mail-in ballot system will be handled correctly. Given Pennsylvania’s current elected officials, he said, “I don’t really trust the ‘powers that be’ will be ethical.”

Nearby, at the Lancaster County Convention Center, more than 150 volunteers and staff were spread out in a large ballroom where the sound of high-speed letter openers had already begun churning through mail ballots. More than 80,000 ballots had been returned by Tuesday morning and county commissioners said they expected to get through all of them by 8 p.m. Results are expected to be posted immediately, with in-person results trickling in until 11 p.m.

“This is the biggest Election Day operation in Lancaster history,” said County Commissioner Josh Parsons, an American flag mask pulled over his mouth. “We think the vast, vast majority will be counted today and uploaded tonight.”

A mile away, at St. John’s Episcopal Church, more than 30 voters stood waiting for the polls to open, but within an hour the line had dissipated and voters trickled in leisurely, stopping at a bake sale set up by the church.

Chuck Pinkerton, an Army veteran, said he thought the quiet morning indicated more people had voted by mail because of the coronavirus. Still, it was important for him to show up in person: “You can’t really complain if you don’t go out and vote.”

Dave Martin, 84, a former science teacher at J.P. McCaskey High School in Lancaster, had baked sugar cookies with red, white, and blue sprinkles in the shape of donkeys and elephants for the occasion.

“Depending on which one you eat, one of them is going to give you indigestion,” Martin said jovially. He recommended the lemon bars instead. <i>— Rebecca Moss of Spotlight PA</i>

## Luzerne County voters head to polls out of habit, to make sure their vote is counted

<i>9:38 a.m.</i>

By 7:30 a.m., a slow-moving line of about 70 people snaked through the parking lot of the Toyota SportsPlex in Wilkes-Barre, the county seat of closely watched Luzerne County.

Several of those waiting said it was their first time voting here, instead of at smaller locations where the wait is normally shorter.

John Sobeck, who had been waiting about 20 minutes, said he was “kind of impatient” but was voting in-person because he didn’t trust the mail. He wouldn’t put cash in the mail, he reasoned, so why would he trust it with his ballot? Jerry and Bridge Ryan said they live “right up the hill” and were voting in person “out of habit.”

Chris Wolfe, who had just voted, said it was “organized chaos” inside the polling place, with everyone crowded “like cattle in a pen.” He said he had voted straight Republican; in the one instance where there was no Republican candidate, he said he wrote in “Satan.”

Tomar Taylor said he had spent 20 minutes in the wrong line inside because it wasn’t clear which line was for which ward. Because of the confusion, he said, “people ended up on top of each other.” But he said everyone was wearing masks and that it was important to him to vote in person to make sure his vote was counted. <i>— Charlotte Keith of Spotlight PA</i>

## Butler County voters say obligation, tradition brought them to the polls

<i>9:22 a.m.</i>

Voters in Cranberry Township in Butler County started lining up around 6 a.m. to be among the first to hit the polls at the Cranberry Municipal Center, which houses three polling locations. Cranberry, about 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, is one of the most populous and fastest-growing areas in the region.

Voters exiting the polls — some of whom voted for Biden, while others voted for Trump — said the mood inside was pleasant and volunteers were organized. Most who arrived before the polls opened or shortly after said they were in and out in an hour. Volunteers were wiping down equipment, most people were wearing masks, and voters were distancing as much as possible.

Dave Trapold Jr., 48, was the eighth person at his polling place this morning.

“I felt that it was important to do it in person, versus mail-in or absentee,” said Trapold, who voted by absentee ballot during the June primary because of work obligations.

{{<picture src="external/x16b6r4s023tqmyrctjtpx3vvg.jpeg" description="Voters line up outside the Cranberry Municipal Center in Cranberry Township, Butler County, in the first hour of voting on Election Day 2020." caption="Voters line up outside the Cranberry Municipal Center in Cranberry Township, Butler County, in the first hour of voting on Election Day 2020." credit="Jamie Martines / Spotlight PA">}} 

He’s always voted for the president in person, and he felt it was important to do that today as well to vote for Trump.

“I’d like to see a little more movement in the economy, getting back to where it was before COVID,” Trapold said, adding that he’d also like to see the president do more work on protecting health care for people with preexisting conditions and bolstering Second Amendment rights.

Trapold exercised his right to open carry at the polls Tuesday, but said he often carries a sidearm. His decision to have his gun on him today wasn’t out of the ordinary, he said.

Robert Smith, 82, who cast his vote for Biden, also kept with tradition to vote in-person. He also wanted to make sure his vote got in — he was worried about mail-in ballots arriving in time.

Smith said he’d like to see elections officials take their time and get the count right.

“Don’t just try to make a snap decision,” he said. “Haste makes waste.” <i>— Jamie Martines of Spotlight PA</i>

## ‘Trust’ is the word of the day in Northampton County

<i>9:04 a.m.</i>

“Trust” was the word several voters in line at St. John’s Windish Evangelical Lutheran Church used when explaining why they were voting in person in Bethlehem.

“I didn’t have confidence in the mail,” said Frank Hostetter, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran who requested a mail ballot just in case he would have to be in Florida on Election Day, tending to his elderly mother.

Instead, he had the ballot in hand, ready to surrender it and cast a vote in person.

Many in line and elsewhere in Northampton County apparently had the same idea. One county election official, who didn’t want to be identified, said polls, including this one, were quickly running out of the forms needed to surrender a mail ballot to cast a vote in person.

{{<picture src="external/0554ed07ph3vw0xefctx8rx1e0.jpeg" description="“Trust” was the word several voters in line at St. John’s Windish Evangelical Lutheran Church used when explaining why they were voting in person in Bethlehem." caption="“Trust” was the word several voters in line at St. John’s Windish Evangelical Lutheran Church used when explaining why they were voting in person in Bethlehem." credit="Marie Albiges / For Spotlight PA">}} 

For first-time voter Audrey Sickles, distrust in the vote-by-mail option also brought her to the polls. The 21-year-old Lehigh University senior said she was excited to cast her vote in person.

“I want to make sure my vote is counted,” she said.

Joyce Moya and Jack Rosario also said they didn’t “trust” the mail, and were voting in person “to make a difference.”

Their son, who is 11, is worried, they said. He’ll probably watch the unofficial results come in with them after the polls close.

“He knows it’s important,” Moya said.

Hostetter, the veteran, said no matter who wins the election, it’s a “celebration of our democracy.” After casting his ballot about 40 minutes later, he said he felt relieved.

“The process worked,” he said. <i>— Marie Albiges for Spotlight PA and </i><a href="https://votebeat.org/" target=_blank><i>Votebeat</i></a>

## 80% of requested mail ballots returned

<i>8:51 a.m.</i>

From <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/live/elections-2020-results-candidates-updates-news-pennsylvania-20201103.html" target=_blank>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s live blog</a>:

"Pennsylvania voters have returned 2.5 million mail ballots, according to data from the Department of State. That’s more than 80% of all ballots requested.

More than 3 million mail ballots have been sent to voters. That leaves nearly 600,000 mail ballots that have not yet been marked as returned. In the last week, more than 790,000 completed mail ballots were returned to county election offices.

Nearly 63% of mail ballots were requested by registered Democrats, while Republicans requested about 25%. Nearly 12 percent were requested by registered independents."

## Lack of trust in the mail and a missing mail ballot in York city

<i>8:37 a.m.</i>

Darcelia Tyson showed up to her York city polling place at about 6:15 a.m.

She wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and a mask with the words faith, hope, and love printed on it. She was first in line.

“I didn’t trust the mail,” said the 65-year-old Tyson, who was a child-care worker before the coronavirus pandemic.

York County is solidly Republican. Four years ago, Trump won the county by 29 percentage points or 60,000 votes. But the city of York is solidly Democratic — Hillary Clinton received over 90% of the votes in Tyson’s precinct.

About a dozen voters waited inside a hallway at Crispus Attucks community center just before the polls opened at 7 a.m. A worker with Election Protection, a voting rights organization, waited outside, holding a sign asking people if they had voting questions.

Sebastian Santos, 20, said Pennsylvania’s new mail-in voting system was stressful. He said he requested a ballot multiple times and never received one.

{{<picture src="external/aag5edpvg88zc90sjb1f7hr22c.jpeg" description="Sebastian Santos, 20, of York, cast a provisional ballot on Tuesday." caption="Sebastian Santos, 20, of York, cast a provisional ballot on Tuesday." credit="Ed Mahon / Spotlight PA">}} 

“The system just says that it was delivered on the 13th, and I should have received it,” Santos said. “I didn’t get anything.”

He cast a provisional ballot on Tuesday. That process was easier than he expected, but those ballots can still be challenged.

“It’s a little worrisome,” Santos said. “But I feel OK that I got to say something, contribute a little bit.” <i>— Ed Mahon of Spotlight PA</i>

## Why one Franklin County voter came to the polls

<i>8:24 p.m.</i>

Robert Williams, 38, is a registered independent and likes both Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump. A new resident of Chambersburg straight out of the military, he told Spotlight PA that he thinks the president “gets blamed for a lot of things that aren’t his fault, necessarily.” 

When asked why he decided to vote in person, in spite of fears of possible intimidation, he said: “I was given an analogy by someone. When you win the lottery, you can either mail in your ticket or drop it off. Why would I mail in my million-dollar ticket?” <i>— Joseph Darius Jaafari of Spotlight PA</i>

## In-person voting begins

<i>8 a.m.</i>

Hundreds of polls across Pennsylvania opened at 7 a.m. and will remain open until 8 p.m.

In Franklin County, Spotlight PA reporter Joseph Darius Jaafari spoke to Barb Beattie, a member of the town council in Chambersburg. As of 7:45 a.m., Beattie said there was an hour-long line at the Chambersburg recreation center. A constable on duty told Jaafari it’s the longest he’s seen this early.

Amanda Wong, 32, said she decided to come in person rather than vote by mail: “I always vote in person. I’m not overthinking it.”

Votebeat reporter Tom Lisi stopped at Edinboro Community Building, about 18 miles south of Erie. Several voters leaving said the line grew to about 50 people by the time polls opened. Aaron Conley, an IT director and supporter of Democrat Joe Biden, said that’s a bit more than a normal presidential election here.

Everyone wore masks inside, several voters said, but voters stood pretty close together — not six feet apart. Five voters said they voted in-person because they did not fully trust the mail-in ballot system. “I just didn’t want to accidentally fill out something that wasn’t official,” Karly Long, an elementary school art teacher and Biden supporter, said. 

An important reminder from Inquirer reporter Jonathan Lai: Issues when the polls open are not unusual or special to 2020.

## How to report problems or get voting info

<i>6:30 a.m.</i>

If you need last-minute voting information, you can seek official answers from the Pennsylvania Department of State by calling 1-877-VOTESPA. The nonpartisan <a href="https://866ourvote.org/" target=_blank>Election Protection coalition</a> has its own hotline, as well: 866-OUR-VOTE.

If you need to lodge a complaint about something you experience while voting, you can call the state’s hotline (1-877-VOTESPA) or reach the department using this <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/ReportElectionComplaints.aspx" target=_blank>form</a>.

And as part of a collaboration with ProPublica’s “<a href="https://www.propublica.org/electionland">Electionland</a>” project, you can report problems at the polls to Spotlight PA <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-2020-election-day-voting-problems-machines-ballots-lawsuits/" target="_blank">using this form. </a><i>— Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA</i>

## What you need to know before heading to the polls

<i>6:30 a.m.</i>

The big day is finally here. If you’ve already voted by mail, congrats — your work is done.

But for those of you heading out to the polls, here’s what you need to know:

- Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Double-check your polling place <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-at-a-Polling-Place.aspx" target=_blank>here</a>.

- In addition to nonpartisan poll workers, you may encounter partisan poll watchers who are sanctioned to observe polling places. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-poll-watchers-can-cant-do-election-day-explainer/" target=_blank>Here’s what they can — and can’t — do</a>.

- Have a completed mail ballot? You can still drop it off today by 8 p.m. Some satellite offices and drop boxes will close before then, <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/pages/drop-box.aspx" target=_blank>so make sure to look up your local details</a>.

- Have a mail ballot but want to vote in person? Bring all of the materials with you to your polling place.

- Requested a mail ballot but it never came in the mail? You can still vote using a <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-by-Provisional-Ballot.aspx" target=_blank>provisional ballot</a>.

- If you are facing a last-minute problem and can’t make it to the polls, you may qualify for an emergency absentee ballot. <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx#emergency%20absentee" target=_blank>Read about those here</a>.

The word of the day is patience. Election officials can only begin processing mail-in and absentee ballots this morning, which means it may take days to report the full results. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pa-election-2020-mail-ballots-precanvassing/" target=_blank>Some counties aren’t planning to begin the process until tomorrow</a>. So if you see any candidates or campaigns declaring victory tonight in hotly contested races, chances are their celebrations are premature. <i>— Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA</i>
