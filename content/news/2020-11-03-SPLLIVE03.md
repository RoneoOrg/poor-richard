## Butler County voters say obligation, tradition brought them to the polls

<i>9:22 a.m.</i>

Voters in Cranberry Township in Butler County started lining up around 6 a.m. to be among the first to hit the polls at the Cranberry Municipal Center, which houses three polling locations. Cranberry, about 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, is one of the most populous and fastest-growing areas in the region.

Voters exiting the polls — some of whom voted for Biden, while others voted for Trump — said the mood inside was pleasant and volunteers were organized. Most who arrived before the polls opened or shortly after said they were in and out in an hour. Volunteers were wiping down equipment, most people were wearing masks, and voters were distancing as much as possible.

Dave Trapold Jr., 48, was the eighth person at his polling place this morning.

“I felt that it was important to do it in person, versus mail-in or absentee,” said Trapold, who voted by absentee ballot during the June primary because of work obligations.

He’s always voted for the president in person, and he felt it was important to do that today as well to vote for Trump.

“I’d like to see a little more movement in the economy, getting back to where it was before COVID,” Trapold said, adding that he’d also like to see the president do more work on protecting health care for people with preexisting conditions and bolstering Second Amendment rights.

Trapold exercised his right to open carry at the polls Tuesday, but said he often carries a sidearm. His decision to have his gun on him today wasn’t out of the ordinary, he said.

Robert Smith, 82, who cast his vote for Biden, also kept with tradition to vote in-person. He also wanted to make sure his vote got in — he was worried about mail-in ballots arriving in time.

Smith said he’d like to see elections officials take their time and get the count right.

“Don’t just try to make a snap decision,” he said. “Haste makes waste.” <i>— Jamie Martines of Spotlight PA</i>

## ‘Trust’ is the word of the day in Northampton County

<i>9:04 a.m.</i>

“Trust” was the word several voters in line at St. John’s Windish Evangelical Lutheran Church used when explaining why they were voting in person in Bethlehem.

“I didn’t have confidence in the mail,” said Frank Hostetter, a 60-year-old Air Force veteran who requested a mail ballot just in case he would have to be in Florida on Election Day, tending to his elderly mother.

Instead, he had the ballot in hand, ready to surrender it and cast a vote in person.

Many in line and elsewhere in Northampton County apparently had the same idea. One county election official, who didn’t want to be identified, said polls, including this one, were quickly running out of the forms needed to surrender a mail ballot to cast a vote in person.

For first-time voter Audrey Sickles, distrust in the vote-by-mail option also brought her to the polls. The 21-year-old Lehigh University senior said she was excited to cast her vote in person.

“I want to make sure my vote is counted,” she said.

Joyce Moya and Jack Rosario also said they didn’t “trust” the mail, and were voting in person “to make a difference.”

Their son, who is 11, is worried, they said. He’ll probably watch the unofficial results come in with them after the polls close.

“He knows it’s important,” Moya said.

Hostetter, the veteran, said no matter who wins the election, it’s a “celebration of our democracy.” After casting his ballot about 40 minutes later, he said he felt relieved.

“The process worked,” he said. <i>— Marie Albiges for Spotlight PA and </i><a href="https://votebeat.org/" target=_blank><i>Votebeat</i></a>

## 80% of requested mail ballots returned

<i>8:51 a.m.</i>

From <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/live/elections-2020-results-candidates-updates-news-pennsylvania-20201103.html" target=_blank>The Philadelphia Inquirer’s live blog</a>:

"Pennsylvania voters have returned 2.5 million mail ballots, according to data from the Department of State. That’s more than 80% of all ballots requested.

More than 3 million mail ballots have been sent to voters. That leaves nearly 600,000 mail ballots that have not yet been marked as returned. In the last week, more than 790,000 completed mail ballots were returned to county election offices.

Nearly 63% of mail ballots were requested by registered Democrats, while Republicans requested about 25%. Nearly 12 percent were requested by registered independents."

## Lack of trust in the mail and a missing mail ballot in York city

<i>8:37 a.m.</i>

Darcelia Tyson showed up to her York city polling place at about 6:15 a.m.

She wore a Black Lives Matter T-shirt and a mask with the words faith, hope, and love printed on it. She was first in line.

“I didn’t trust the mail,” said the 65-year-old Tyson, who was a child-care worker before the coronavirus pandemic.

York County is solidly Republican. Four years ago, Trump won the county by 29 percentage points or 60,000 votes. But the city of York is solidly Democratic — Hillary Clinton received over 90% of the votes in Tyson’s precinct.

About a dozen voters waited inside a hallway at Crispus Attucks community center just before the polls opened at 7 a.m. A worker with Election Protection, a voting rights organization, waited outside, holding a sign asking people if they had voting questions.

Sebastian Santos, 20, said Pennsylvania’s new mail-in voting system was stressful. He said he requested a ballot multiple times and never received one.

{{<picture src="external/aag5edpvg88zc90sjb1f7hr22c.jpeg" description="Sebastian Santos, 20, of York, cast a provisional ballot on Tuesday." caption="Sebastian Santos, 20, of York, cast a provisional ballot on Tuesday." credit="Ed Mahon / Spotlight PA">}} 

“The system just says that it was delivered on the 13th, and I should have received it,” Santos said. “I didn’t get anything.”

He cast a provisional ballot on Tuesday. That process was easier than he expected, but those ballots can still be challenged.

“It’s a little worrisome,” Santos said. “But I feel OK that I got to say something, contribute a little bit.” <i>— Ed Mahon of Spotlight PA</i>

## Why one Franklin County voter came to the polls

<i>8:24 p.m.</i>

Robert Williams, 38, is a registered independent and likes both Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump. A new resident of Chambersburg straight out of the military, he told Spotlight PA that he thinks the president “gets blamed for a lot of things that aren’t his fault, necessarily.” 

When asked why he decided to vote in person, in spite of fears of possible intimidation, he said: “I was given an analogy by someone. When you win the lottery, you can either mail in your ticket or drop it off. Why would I mail in my million-dollar ticket?” <i>— Joseph Darius Jaafari of Spotlight PA</i>

## In-person voting begins

<i>8 a.m.</i>

Hundreds of polls across Pennsylvania opened at 7 a.m. and will remain open until 8 p.m.

In Franklin County, Spotlight PA reporter Joseph Darius Jaafari spoke to Barb Beattie, a member of the town council in Chambersburg. As of 7:45 a.m., Beattie said there was an hour-long line at the Chambersburg recreation center. A constable on duty told Jaafari it’s the longest he’s seen this early.

Amanda Wong, 32, said she decided to come in person rather than vote by mail: “I always vote in person. I’m not overthinking it.”

Votebeat reporter Tom Lisi stopped at Edinboro Community Building, about 18 miles south of Erie. Several voters leaving said the line grew to about 50 people by the time polls opened. Aaron Conley, an IT director and supporter of Democrat Joe Biden, said that’s a bit more than a normal presidential election here.

Everyone wore masks inside, several voters said, but voters stood pretty close together — not six feet apart. Five voters said they voted in-person because they did not fully trust the mail-in ballot system. “I just didn’t want to accidentally fill out something that wasn’t official,” Karly Long, an elementary school art teacher and Biden supporter, said. 

An important reminder from Inquirer reporter Jonathan Lai: Issues when the polls open are not unusual or special to 2020.

## What you need to know before heading to the polls

<i>6:30 a.m.</i>

The big day is finally here. If you’ve already voted by mail, congrats — your work is done.

But for those of you heading out to the polls, here’s what you need to know:

- Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Double-check your polling place <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-at-a-Polling-Place.aspx" target=_blank>here</a>.

- In addition to nonpartisan poll workers, you may encounter partisan poll watchers who are sanctioned to observe polling places. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-poll-watchers-can-cant-do-election-day-explainer/" target=_blank>Here’s what they can — and can’t — do</a>.

- Have a completed mail ballot? You can still drop it off today by 8 p.m. Some satellite offices and drop boxes will close before then, <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/pages/drop-box.aspx" target=_blank>so make sure to look up your local details</a>.

- Have a mail ballot but want to vote in person? Bring all of the materials with you to your polling place.

- Requested a mail ballot but it never came in the mail? You can still vote using a <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-by-Provisional-Ballot.aspx" target=_blank>provisional ballot</a>.

- If you are facing a last-minute problem and can’t make it to the polls, you may qualify for an emergency absentee ballot. <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx#emergency%20absentee" target=_blank>Read about those here</a>.

The word of the day is patience. Election officials can only begin processing mail-in and absentee ballots this morning, which means it may take days to report the full results. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pa-election-2020-mail-ballots-precanvassing/" target=_blank>Some counties aren’t planning to begin the process until tomorrow</a>. So if you see any candidates or campaigns declaring victory tonight in hotly contested races, chances are their celebrations are premature. <i>— Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA</i>
