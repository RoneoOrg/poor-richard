## Why one Franklin County voter came to the polls

<i>8:24 p.m.</i>

Robert Williams, 38, is a registered independent and likes both Democrat Joe Biden and Republican Donald Trump. A new resident of Chambersburg straight out of the military, he told Spotlight PA that he thinks the president ‚Äúgets blamed for a lot of things that aren‚Äôt his fault, necessarily.‚Äù 

When asked why he decided to vote in person, in spite of fears of possible intimidation, he said: ‚ÄúI was given an analogy by someone. When you win the lottery, you can either mail in your ticket or drop it off. Why would I mail in my million-dollar ticket?‚Äù <i>‚Äî Joseph Darius Jaafari of Spotlight PA</i>

## In-person voting begins

<i>8 a.m.</i>

Hundreds of polls across Pennsylvania opened at 7 a.m. and will remain open until 8 p.m.

In Franklin County, Spotlight PA reporter Joseph Darius Jaafari spoke to Barb Beattie, a member of the town council in Chambersburg. As of 7:45 a.m., Beattie said there was an hour-long line at the Chambersburg recreation center. A constable on duty told Jaafari it‚Äôs the longest he‚Äôs seen this early.

Amanda Wong, 32, said she decided to come in person rather than vote by mail: ‚ÄúI always vote in person. I‚Äôm not overthinking it.‚Äù

Votebeat reporter Tom Lisi stopped at Edinboro Community Building, about 18 miles south of Erie. Several voters leaving said the line grew to about 50 people by the time polls opened. Aaron Conley, an IT director and supporter of Democrat Joe Biden, said that‚Äôs a bit more than a normal presidential election here.

Everyone wore masks inside, several voters said, but voters stood pretty close together ‚Äî not six feet apart. Five voters said they voted in-person because they did not fully trust the mail-in ballot system. ‚ÄúI just didn‚Äôt want to accidentally fill out something that wasn‚Äôt official,‚Äù Karly Long, an elementary school art teacher and Biden supporter, said. 

An important reminder from Inquirer reporter Jonathan Lai: Issues when the polls open are not unusual or special to 2020.

## How to report problems or get voting info

<i>6:30 a.m.</i>

If you need last-minute voting information, you can seek official answers from the Pennsylvania Department of State by calling 1-877-VOTESPA. The nonpartisan <a href="https://866ourvote.org/" target=_blank>Election Protection coalition</a> has its own hotline, as well: 866-OUR-VOTE.

If you need to lodge a complaint about something you experience while voting, you can call the state‚Äôs hotline (1-877-VOTESPA) or reach the department using this <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/Pages/ReportElectionComplaints.aspx" target=_blank>form</a>.

And as part of a collaboration with ProPublica‚Äôs ‚Äú<a href="https://www.propublica.org/electionland">Electionland</a>‚Äù project, you can report problems at the polls to Spotlight PA <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-2020-election-day-voting-problems-machines-ballots-lawsuits/" target="_blank">using this form. </a><i>‚Äî Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA</i>

## What you need to know before heading to the polls

<i>6:30 a.m.</i>

The big day is finally here. If you‚Äôve already voted by mail, congrats ‚Äî your work is done.

But for those of you heading out to the polls, here‚Äôs what you need to know:

- Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Double-check your polling place <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-at-a-Polling-Place.aspx" target=_blank>here</a>.

- In addition to nonpartisan poll workers, you may encounter partisan poll watchers who are sanctioned to observe polling places. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/10/pa-poll-watchers-can-cant-do-election-day-explainer/" target=_blank>Here‚Äôs what they can ‚Äî and can‚Äôt ‚Äî do</a>.

- Have a completed mail ballot? You can still drop it off today by 8 p.m. Some satellite offices and drop boxes will close before then, <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/pages/drop-box.aspx" target=_blank>so make sure to look up your local details</a>.

- Have a mail ballot but want to vote in person? Bring all of the materials with you to your polling place.

- Requested a mail ballot but it never came in the mail? You can still vote using a <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Voting-by-Provisional-Ballot.aspx" target=_blank>provisional ballot</a>.

- If you are facing a last-minute problem and can‚Äôt make it to the polls, you may qualify for an emergency absentee ballot. <a href="https://www.votespa.com/Voting-in-PA/Pages/Mail-and-Absentee-Ballot.aspx#emergency%20absentee" target=_blank>Read about those here</a>.

The word of the day is patience. Election officials can only begin processing mail-in and absentee ballots this morning, which means it may take days to report the full results. <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/pa-election-2020-mail-ballots-precanvassing/" target=_blank>Some counties aren‚Äôt planning to begin the process until tomorrow</a>. So if you see any candidates or campaigns declaring victory tonight in hotly contested races, chances are their celebrations are premature. <i>‚Äî Sarah Anne Hughes of Spotlight PA</i>
