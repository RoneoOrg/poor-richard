HARRISBURG — The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has selected a new congressional map for the state from among more than a dozen submitted by Gov. Tom Wolf, top lawmakers, good-government groups, and voters.

The Democrat-controlled high court picked the map submitted by the Carter petitioners, a group of Pennsylvania voters who brought a lawsuit asking the state courts to take over the congressional redistricting process.

Their map is as similar as possible to the current congressional map, with 86% of residents staying in the same district. Matthew Gorden, their counsel, told the court last Friday that this approach of “least change” should be valued over other considerations.

Gorden said the map was guided by that principle and not motivated by partisan intentions.

“We don’t have visibility into why most of the other maps ended up where they did,” he said. “We do for the Carter map.”
