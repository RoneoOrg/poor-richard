HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania politicos are preparing for an intense 2022 election, with open seats for U.S. Senate and governor on the November ballot. The field is still taking shape, but it’s already clear there’s a lot at stake — both races are <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/governor-race-ratings">currently</a> <a href="https://cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings">categorized</a> by the Cook Political Report as toss-ups.

The race for governor may get less national attention, but the outcome will determine the balance of power in Harrisburg and could radically shape policies on everything from <a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/2021/05/25/pennsylvania-abortion-bills-advance/7430884002/">abortion</a> to voting rights in the years to come. Here’s what we know about the candidates so far.

### Democrats

It’s looking more and more likely this will be a field of one.

After months of speculation, Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro announced his candidacy in mid-October.

It&#39;s time we all get in the game and fight for our rights, our democracy, our Commonwealth.<br><br>This will be one of the closest races in the country — and I need you on my team.

### Republicans

There are a lot of names in the mix on the Republican side. 

Among those who have declared their candidacy: <a href="https://www.loubarletta.com/">Lou Barletta</a>, a former member of Congress who first rose to national prominence because of his <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/politics/barletta-trump-immigration-hazleton-pennsylvania-20180716.html">anti-immigration policies as mayor of Hazleton</a>; former U.S. Attorney <a href="https://billmcswain.com/" target="_blank">Bill McSwain</a>; and <a href="https://apnews.com/article/legislature-caba352a4ccccf096e511c0ed2e0ddfd" target="_blank">Jake Corman</a>, president pro tempore of the state Senate.

Several other Republicans are publicly considering a run. 

State Sen. Doug Mastriano, a right-wing lawmaker who <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/11/rudy-giuliani-trump-pennsylvania-election-senate-hearing/">hosted a hearing</a> devoted to unfounded claims of 2020 election fraud and <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/01/doug-mastriano-trump-capitol-attack-resignation-investigation/">marched to the U.S. Capitol</a> before the Jan. 6 insurrection, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-government-and-politics-3e72340ae5766adac3a75eb744f5bcc6">claimed former President Donald Trump asked him to run</a> and promised to help him campaign. (An aide says Trump “<a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-pennsylvania-government-and-politics-f2384a82f84d98881e9de68e28846920">has not made any endorsement or commitments yet</a>.”)

In early November, Mastriano announced he had <a href="https://twitter.com/StephenJ_Caruso/status/1456576178832257026?s=20" target="_blank">established</a> an exploratory committee. 

U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, of Western Pennsylvania, also believes <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-politics-trump-republicans-insigh/eyeing-2022-elections-republicans-jockey-for-trumps-blessing-idUSKBN2BA11Q">his relationship with Trump could be an asset</a> should he run for governor. Another member of the state’s congressional delegation, Dan Meuser of Luzerne County, considered a run but <a href="https://www.timesleader.com/news/1517668/meuser-decides-not-to-run-for-governor-will-seek-re-election-to-congress" target="_blank">ultimately decided against it</a>.

At least two state senators — <a href="https://www.goerie.com/story/news/politics/elections/2021/11/11/laughlin-corman-pa-senate-leadership-job-gubernatorial/6336573001/" target="_blank">Dan Laughlin</a> of Erie County and <a href="https://martin4pa.com/news" target="_blank">Scott Martin</a> of Lancaster County — are also potential candidates. 

### Other

So far, two people who aren’t members of a major party have declared their intention to run:
