HARRISBURG — Hundreds of people, both in cars and on foot, gathered outside the state Capitol in Harrisburg on Monday for a rally to “reopen” Pennsylvania.

Pennsylvania residents are currently under a stay-at-home order, which public health experts consider essential to slow the spread of the coronavirus and keep infections at a manageable level for hospitals.

There are more than 33,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state, according to the Department of Health, as well as 1,204 confirmed deaths.

The Department of General Services closed the Capitol complex on March 13, just a few days before Gov. Tom Wolf ordered nonessential businesses to shut down physical operations. A spokesperson said the department was aware that an “unauthorized” rally was planned.

Jodie Zeiders of Reading said she attended Monday’s rally because of her friends who are small business owners. She said she wants them to be able to reopen safely, while practicing social distancing and offering workers’ protections.

Stan Casacio, co-host of the AM radio show "Don’t Back Down,” said Wolf should create a committee with lawmakers and business owners to decide which businesses should reopen. “Give us an opportunity. I think most people are here to demand transparency as to why some businesses are open, some are not open,” he said. “Poverty kills also.”

While some of the hundreds in attendance were wearing masks, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many were not. Unlike the flu, COVID-19 “might be spread through the airborne route, meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near,” <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/coronavirus-disease-2019-vs-the-flu" target=_blank>according</a> to Johns Hopkins Medicine. 

Monday’s demonstration was planned in part by Chris Dorr, an Ohio-based far-right activist who <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/19/pro-gun-activists-using-facebook-groups-push-anti-quarantine-protests/">organized similar protests with his brothers</a> in other states. Dorr also spearheaded the Pennsylvania Firearms Association, a registered 501(c) 4, which claims there is a “war against the Second Amendment.”

Law enforcement in Ohio is reviewing a Facebook video in which Dorr said “there will be political bodies laying all over the ground" in future elections, the Columbus Dispatch <a href="https://www.dispatch.com/news/20190809/patrol-reviewing-video-by-gun-rights-advocate-threatening-bodies-laying-all-over-ground" target="_blank">reported</a>.

Annamarie Scannapieco, who helped organize a “back-to-work” rally that was moved to Monday, is an ER nurse and a Republican running for a state House seat in Montgomery County. She said on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=252605309214853&set=a.112775863197799&type=3&theater">Facebook</a> she would no longer attend in person because she didn’t “want to risk the health of potential patients should I happen to come in contact with a COVID-19 infected person.”

“With that said, I still 100% support the cause, as well as the people’s right to assemble peaceful to rally or protest,” she wrote in a post, which later appeared to be deleted.

Several Republican lawmakers were in attendance, including state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R., Franklin) who <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SenatorDougMastriano/videos/266282137740779/" target=_blank>live-streamed protesters</a> before the rally officially began. “We need to open up now,” he told those assembled.

Speaking on the steps of the Capitol, state Rep. Aaron Bernstine (R., Lawrence) led chants and asked protesters to tell Wolf to sign a bill aimed at reopening some businesses closed amid the government-ordered shutdown. Wolf has said he will veto the <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-coronavirus-legislature-senate-vote-reopen-business/" target=_blank>legislation</a>, which Health Secretary Rachel Levine told lawmakers would put “more lives at risk.”

“These leaders must not focus on just the lives at risk from the horrible virus,” Bernstine said. “Many lives like yours are in danger from a shuttered business, the hunger and homelessness.”

State Rep. Russ Diamond (R., Lebanon) also spoke to the crowd, telling them, “I believe that every one of you is essential and that every one of your businesses and jobs is life-sustaining.”

State Sen. Judy Ward (R., Blair) questioned government mandates, saying: “Do we need the government to mandate that certain business close? No. ... Do we need the government to mandate that we must wear a face mask? Or how about businesses that have to provide face masks that aren’t available?”

There were a small number of counter-protests. Christie Stevenson, who protested against the rally from the stoop of her apartment building near the Capitol, said she has been social distancing to protect those who are more vulnerable. 

“I have been sheltering in place to take care of my parents, their parents, everybody’s parents,” she said. “I think the small business owners who are here today don’t care enough about their employees. I yelled at a few of them that I would be ashamed of them if they were my boss.”

Nurses with Services Employees International Union also demonstrated, holding signs that urged people to go home.

Wolf in March began putting counties hit hardest by the coronavirus under a stay-at-home order, eventually expanding it statewide April 1. The order calls on people to leave their homes only for essential items, such as food or medicine.

There is widespread support for expanding a stay-at-home order, which many states have already instituted, nationwide. A recent Quinnipiac University poll <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us04082020_uksb19.pdf">found</a> that 81% of voters would back such an effort.

Wolf and Levine last week both urged people to stay the course.

“Let’s continue to make this good progress and keep people safe, and when the time is right, we will reopen and liberate every single Pennsylvanian,” Wolf said.

As protesters gathered outside the Capitol, Wolf said Monday he is extending his stay-at-home order until May 8 and will allow some construction projects to reopen then. He said he had not seen firsthand the protesters who were gathered in Harrisburg, but said he respected their right to express themselves. 

“Obviously this is a democracy,” he said. “Everyone has the right to express their opinions. I’m just hoping that they, like every other Pennsylvanian, recognize that we want to keep each other safe.” 

While a New Jersey woman was arrested Friday for organizing a similar gathering in Trenton, Wolf said there were no plans to enforce executive orders during Monday’s protest.
