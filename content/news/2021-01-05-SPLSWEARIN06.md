HARRISBURG â€” The new session of the Pennsylvania Senate got off to a chaotic start Tuesday, with Republicans refusing to seat a Democratic senator whose election victory has been certified by state officials.

Amid high emotions and partisan fingerpointing, Republicans also took the rare step of removing the Democratic lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, from presiding over the session. They apparently did so because they did not believe Fetterman was following the rules and recognizing their legislative motions.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The result: it&#39;s almost like two parallel sessions are unfolding in the Senate... what the GOP is running; and what the Democrats, who are in the minority, are trying to accomplish, without being recognized.</p>&mdash; Angela Couloumbis (@AngelasInk) <a href="https://twitter.com/AngelasInk/status/1346522333717159940?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2021</a></blockquote>

For now, at least, Democratic state Sen. Jim Brewster, of Allegheny County, will not be allowed to take the oath of office, as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/01/jim-brewster-pennsylvania-senate-gop-refuse-to-seat-nicole-ziccarelli/">Republicans believe litigation over the outcome in his race must first play out in the courts</a>.

Brewster narrowly won reelection over Republican challenger Nicole Ziccarelli, who is asking a federal judge to throw out the election results. At the heart of that legal dispute is several hundred mail ballots that lacked a date by voters, as required by state law. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court allowed those ballots to be counted, which gave Brewster the edge in the race.
