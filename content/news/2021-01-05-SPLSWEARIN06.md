HARRISBURG â€” The new session of the Pennsylvania Senate got off to a chaotic start Tuesday, with Republicans refusing to seat a Democratic senator whose election victory has been certified by state officials.

Amid high emotions and partisan fingerpointing, Republicans also took the rare step of removing the Democratic lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, from running the session.

For now, at least, Democratic state Sen. Jim Brewster, of Allegheny County, will not be allowed to take the oath of office, as <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2021/01/jim-brewster-pennsylvania-senate-gop-refuse-to-seat-nicole-ziccarelli/" target=_blank>Republicans believe litigation over the outcome in his race must first play out in the courts</a>.

Brewster narrowly won reelection over Republican challenger Nicole Ziccarelli, who is asking a federal judge to throw out the election results.
