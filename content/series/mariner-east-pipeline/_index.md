A yearlong investigation chronicling one of the most controversial infrastructure projects in Pennsylvania’s history. Investigative Reporter Rebecca Moss traveled the length of the Mariner East pipeline system in Pennsylvania. Along the route, she interviewed dozens of people whose homes, schools, and communities of worship were feet from the pipeline to learn about what they knew and how they had been informed — or not informed — about how to handle a potential emergency. In total, Moss conducted more than 80 interviews  and reviewed hundreds of pages of documents from case records, state violation records, planning documents, federal data, and incident reports.
